   A tool for finding graph :term:`minor-embedding`\ s, developed to embed :term:`Ising` problems onto quantum annealers (QA).

   While it can be used to find minors in arbitrary graphs, it is particularly geared
   towards the state of the art in QA: problem graphs of a few to a few hundred variables,
   and hardware graphs of a few thousand qubits.

.. dropdown:: **penaltymodel** --- Maps constraints to binary quadratic models. \
   :link-badge:`https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_penalty/sdk_index.html, "docs", cls=badge-primary fr text-white` \
   :link-badge:`https://github.com/dwavesystems/penaltymodel, "code", cls=badge-secondary fr text-white`

   An approach to solve a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) using an :term:`Ising`
   model or a :term:`QUBO`, is to map each individual constraint in the CSP to a ‘small’
   Ising model or QUBO.

   Includes a local cache for penalty models and a factory that generates penalty models
   using SMT solvers.

.. dropdown:: **pyqubo** --- Creates quadratic models from mathematical expressions. \
   :link-badge:`https://pyqubo.readthedocs.io/en/latest, "docs", cls=badge-primary fr text-white` \
   :link-badge:`https://github.com/recruit-communications/pyqubo, "code", cls=badge-secondary fr text-white`

   A package that helps you create QUBOs and Ising models from flexible mathematical expressions.

   :link-badge:`https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/qbsolv/en/latest/, "docs", cls=badge-primary fr text-white` \
   :link-badge:`https://github.com/dwavesystems/qbsolv, "code", cls=badge-secondary fr text-white`

   A decomposing solver that finds a minimum value of a large quadratic unconstrained binary
   optimization (:term:`QUBO`) problem by splitting it into pieces. The pieces are solved
   using a classical solver running the tabu algorithm. qbsolv also enables configuring
   a D-Wave system as the solver.
