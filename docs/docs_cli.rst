=========
dwave CLI
=========

As part of the installation of the
`dwave-ocean-sdk <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk>`_
a `dwave` executable is installed; for example, in a virtual environment it might
be installed as `<virtual_environment>\\Scripts\\dwave.exe`. Running this file from
your system's console opens an interactive command line interface (CLI) that can
help you set up and configure your development environment, communicate with
D-Wave compute resources, and other useful actions.

Run :code:`dwave -- help` for information on all the CLI options. For **SDK
version 4.0.0** the CLI provided the following commands and options
(see the output in your installation for the latest):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ dwave

    Usage: dwave [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

      D-Wave Cloud Client interactive configuration tool.

    Options:
      --version    Show the version and exit.
      --debug      Enable debug logging.
      --trace      Enable trace-level debug logging.
      --log LEVEL  Set custom numeric or symbolic log level.
      --platform   Show the platform tags and exit.
      --help       Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      config   Create, update or inspect cloud client configuration file(s).
      install  Install optional non-open-source Ocean packages.
      ping     Ping the QPU by submitting a single-qubit problem.
      sample   Submit Ising-formulated problem and return samples.
      setup    Setup optional Ocean packages and configuration file(s).
      solvers  Get solver details.
      upload   Multipart problem upload with cold restart support.

.. note:: If you work in a Bash shell and want command completion for `dwave`, add

          .. code-block:: bash

             eval "$(_DWAVE_COMPLETE=source <path>/dwave)"

          to your shell's `.bashrc` configuration file, where `<path>` is the absolute
          path to the installed `dwave` executable, for example `/home/Mary/my-quantum-app/env/bin`.

Below are shown example sessions for some of the commands:

* :ref:`cli_example_setup`
* :ref:`cli_example_config`
* :ref:`cli_example_ping`
* :ref:`cli_example_solvers`

.. _cli_example_setup:

Setup
=====

The :code:`dwave setup` command optionally installs non-open-source packages
and configures your environment.

The output shown below includes the interactive prompts and placeholder replies
for a full setup.

.. _cli_example_ping:

Ping
====

The :code:`dwave ping` command tests communications with the quantum computer
configured using the :code:`dwave setup` or :code:`dwave config` commands.

.. cli-example-ping-start-marker

The example below, for a Bash Unix shell, pings only QPU solvers.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ dwave ping -s '{"qpu": true}'
    Using endpoint: https://cloud.dwavesys.com/sapi
    Using solver: My_DWAVE_2000Q

     * Solver definition fetch: 2007.239 ms
     * Problem submit and results fetch: 1033.931 ms
     * Total: 3041.171 ms

    QPU timing:
     * total_real_time = 10493 us
     * anneal_time_per_run = 20 us
     * post_processing_overhead_time = 128 us
