*   Qubit temperature: Some qubits in this QPU are affected
    by high-frequency photon flux and may have a higher temperature than
    what is reported here. For more information, see the discussion of
    high-energy photon flux in the :ref:`qpu_errors` section.

*   The ferromagnetic problem and single-qubit freezeout points shown are
    :ref:`normalized anneal fraction <qpu_qa_implementation>` values.

*   Readout time range: Typical readout times for reading between one qubit
    and the full QPU.

*   Programming time: Typical for problems run on
    this QPU. Actual problem programming times may vary slightly depending
    on the nature of the problem.

*   Readout error rate: Error rate when reading the full system.
