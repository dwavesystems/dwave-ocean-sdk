qbsolv

A decomposing solver that finds a minimum value of a large quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem by splitting it into pieces. The pieces are solved using a classical solver running the tabu algorithm. qbsolv also enables configuring a D-Wave system as the solver.

.. attention::
   The qbsolv package is deprecated as of the end of 2021 and is planned for
   removal in an Ocean SDK release after March 2022.

   Please update your code to use the :ref:`sdk_index_hybrid` package or
   `Leap's <https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/>`_ hybrid solvers instead.
