Installing Ocean Tools
======================

Ocean software is supported on the following operating systems:

* **Linux:** tested on 64-bit OS
* **Windows:** tested on 64-bit Windows 8, 10
* **Mac:** tested on macOS 10.15.5 (Xcode 12.2)

Ocean software requires a :ref:`Python environment<pythonEnvironment>`. Python
versions |python_requires| are supported.

This section explains how to :ref:`install Ocean software<installOceanSoftware>`,
either the entire suite of tools or particular tools\ [#]_ from the D-Wave GitHub
repositories listed in the navigation bar.

.. [#]
  Although individual Ocean packages accept dependencies within a range of
  versions, not all combinations are tested. Only versions of individual Ocean
  tools that form part of an official release of the Ocean SDK are guaranteed to
  work together.

.. _pythonEnvironment:

Python Virtual Environment
==========================

It's recommended that you work in a
`virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ on your
local machine; depending on your operating system, you may need to first install
Python.

1. `Download Python <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_ describes how to install
   Python on your local machine for supported operating system.

   .. attention::
      For Windows systems, note that only **64-bit** Python is supported.

#. Create a virtual environment for your Ocean work. For example, on Unix systems
   you might do:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python -m venv ocean
       . ocean/bin/activate

   (On Windows operating system, activating a virtual environment might be done
   with the :code:`Scripts\activate` command instead.)

Your machine is now ready to install Ocean software.

.. _installOceanSoftware:

Install Ocean Software
======================

The simplest way to start is to install
`dwave-ocean-sdk <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk>`_ for the full
suite of Ocean tools.

You can :code:`pip install` the SDK inside your newly created virtual environment.

* For a standard installation of the latest released version from
  the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`_ repository:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip install dwave-ocean-sdk

* Advanced users might directly install the latest (development) SDK from the
  `D-Wave GitHub <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk>`_ repository
  using a command such as,

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip install git+https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk

Alternatively, you can clone the
`dwave-ocean-sdk <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk>`_ repo
and install the SDK to your virtual environment; for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk.git
    cd dwave-ocean-sdk
    python setup.py install

Note: To install a particular tool within the SDK only, follow the link to the
GitHub repository for the tool, as listed in the navigation bar, and follow the
installation instructions on the README file.

.. _dwave_setup:

Set Up Your Environment
=======================

For a full and easy development experience it is recommended that before you start
writing code, you complete the setup of your environment with two last steps:

* :ref:`setup_install`

  Adds non-open-source tools such as the :ref:`inspector`.
* :ref:`sapi_access`

  Sets defaults used for accessing D-Wave compute resources.

The `dwave-ocean-sdk <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk>`_
includes an :ref:`interactive CLI <dwave_cli>` that steps you through setup.

In the virtual environment you created as part of :ref:`install`, run the
:code:`dwave setup` command. The output shown below includes the interactive
prompts and placeholder replies for a full setup.

.. tip:: New users can accept the :code:`dwave setup` commandâ€™s defaults (press
   Enter) for all prompts except the authentication token, which is displayed on
   the `Leap <https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/>`_ dashboard for your account.
   Section :ref:`sapi_access` explains how you can update your work environment's
   configuration at any time.

.. include:: ../docs_cli.rst
  :start-after: cli-example-setup-start-marker
  :end-before: cli-example-setup-end-marker

.. _setup_install:

Install Contributor Ocean Tools
-------------------------------

The interactive :code:`dwave setup` and :code:`dwave install` commands of the
the `dwave-ocean-sdk <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk>`_ step
you through installation of non-open-source ("contrib") tools.

If you did not install contributor packages with the :code:`dwave setup` command
in the :ref:`dwave_setup` section, or want to add packages at a later time, you
can use it again then or use the :code:`dwave install` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ dwave install --help
    Usage: dwave install [OPTIONS] [PACKAGES]...

       Install optional non-open-source Ocean packages.

    Options:
      -l, --list     List available contrib (non-OSS) packages
      -a, --all      Install all contrib (non-OSS) packages
      -v, --verbose  Increase output verbosity
      --help         Show this message and exit.

Both commands describe the tools and enable you to select which if any to install.

Most Ocean tools solve problems on a :term:`solver`, which is a compute resource
such as a D-Wave system or CPU, and might require that you configure a default solver.
:ref:`sapi_access` describes the next step of setting up your environment, how to
configure your system to access D-Wave or other remote solvers.
