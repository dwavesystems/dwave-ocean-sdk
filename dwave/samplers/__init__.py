A unified namespace for :class:`dimod.Sampler`s.

This namespace is populated by entry points. To contribute a sampler, you
must identify it in your setup.py file like so.

.. code-block:: python

    entry_points = {'dwave.samplers': ['YourSampler = import.path.to.sampler:YourSampler']}

    setup(
        entry_points=entry_points,
        ...
    )

# add the samplers to the module from entrypoints, name conflicts override
globals().update((ep.name, ep.load()) for ep in iter_entry_points('dwave.samplers'))
del iter_entry_points  # remove from namespace
