# AGENTS.md — <package name>

<!--
Per-package instructions for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
etc.). Tool-agnostic on purpose: most tools read AGENTS.md natively;
Claude Code reads it via the one-line CLAUDE.md stub in this repo.

Keep this file short and factual. The shared Ocean-wide baseline lives in
the dwave-ocean-sdk repo and is fetched on demand (see "Ocean Baseline").
If you correct an agent twice about the same package fact, add it here.
-->

## Project Overview

<!-- 2–4 lines. What this package is and anything surprising about it.
     Example (dimod-style): "Shared API for binary quadratic samplers.
     Core is C++ under dimod/include/ with Cython bindings; files under
     dimod/*.cpp are generated — edit the .pyx sources instead." -->

## Commands

<!-- Exact, copy-pasteable. Replace the examples with this package's real
     invocations, or remove if not used. This is the highest-value section in
     the file. -->

- Setup: `python -m venv .venv && pip install -r requirements.txt -r tests/requirements.txt`
- Build extensions (if Cython/C++): `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
- Test (all): `python -m pytest tests/`
- Test (single file): `python -m pytest tests/test_<name>.py -x`
- Lint: `<package's lint command, e.g. ruff check . / flake8>`
- Docs build: `make -C docs html`
- Release note: `reno new <slug>`

## Architecture Notes

<!-- Only facts an agent can't infer by reading the code, and only ones
     you'd otherwise repeat in review. Delete if empty — don't pad. -->

- <e.g. "Public API is what's re-exported in <pkg>/__init__.py; underscore
  modules are internal and not covered by semver.">

## Non-negotiables (always apply)

<!-- Copied from the Ocean baseline so they hold even when nothing is
     fetched. Keep this list short and in sync with CONTRIBUTING.rst. -->

- One focused feature/fix per PR.
- Document any public API you add or change.
- Add a release note with `reno` for user-visible changes.
- Make the smallest change that solves the problem; don't refactor
  unrelated code unless asked.
