# Ocean SDK — Shared Agent Baseline

<!--
Canonical home: the dwave-ocean-sdk repository, next to CONTRIBUTING.rst.
This file is the shared baseline for AI coding agents across all Ocean
packages. Package repos do NOT copy this file; their AGENTS.md carries
their own project facts plus the "Non-negotiables" below inline, and
fetches this file on demand (see the per-package template).
-->

## Working Style

- State your assumptions and a short plan of verifiable goals before editing.
- If the task is ambiguous, ask at most one clarifying question; otherwise
  proceed.
- Make the smallest change that solves the problem; don't touch or refactor
  unrelated code unless asked.
- Before finishing, verify with the narrowest relevant test (see the
  package's `## Commands` section for how to run them).

## Context and Tool Use

- Prefer targeted reads (`grep`, `sed -n 'START,ENDp'`, symbol search) over
  reading whole files.
- Review your edits with `git diff -- <path>` before declaring done.

## Python Defaults

- Use `pip` and `python -m venv` for dependency and environment commands.
- Support all Python versions the package declares: check `requires-python`
  in `pyproject.toml` (or `python_requires` in setup.py/setup.cfg — packages
  vary) before writing code, and target the minimum version. Don't use
  syntax or stdlib features newer than the floor (e.g. `match`, `X | Y`
  unions, `tomllib`) unless the floor allows them.
- Use `logging` instead of `print()` in library code.
- Add type hints to public functions, including return types.
- Never silently swallow exceptions: catch only exceptions you can
  meaningfully handle, and let the rest propagate.
- Ask before adding a runtime dependency. Ocean packages keep dependencies
  minimal; new ones affect the whole SDK's install footprint.

## Code Quality

- Match the existing package style before introducing a new pattern; Ocean
  packages differ in age and conventions, so the surrounding code wins over
  personal preference.
- Avoid speculative abstractions for single-use code.
- Keep functions focused; prefer splitting once a function does more than
  one thing (rough guide: ~50 lines).
- After edits, run the package's lint command (see its `## Commands`), if there
  is one, and fix what it reports.

## Commits and Pull Requests

- When preparing a commit or PR, fetch and follow the full contributing
  guide:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk/refs/heads/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst
- The non-negotiables (listed in each package's AGENTS.md) always apply,
  even if the guide was not fetched.

## Communication

- Be concise.
- Call out trade-offs when multiple reasonable approaches exist.
- Push back if a safer or smaller approach would meet the goal.
- When you notice but deliberately don't fix something (adjacent bugs,
  refactoring opportunities, related cleanup), say so briefly and why.
  Don't fix it silently, and don't omit it silently. Skip this when
  there's nothing to report.
